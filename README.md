# Team 1 — Variant Prioritization

A group project exploring **deep learning methods in genomics**. Each member takes one
research paper, sets up the authors' original code, **runs the model on the example / demo
data, and captures the output** (variant calls, basecalls, cell maps, contact maps, etc.).
Paper #5 (the Eraslan et al. review) is also part of Aditya's work — it surveys the
field rather than shipping one tool, so the exact approach is still being figured out.

---

## 🎯 Goal

For each paper:

1. Get the authors' codebase running (their GitHub repo is linked below).
2. Run the model on the provided demo / example data — **inference only, no training needed**.
3. Save the output into that paper's folder, with a short note on what it shows.

> **Note on compute.** These are heavy deep-learning tools built for **Linux + GPU**, so
> they are hard to run natively on Windows. The practical routes for getting output are:
> - **Google Colab** — free GPU, Linux, ready-made notebooks → best for **Akita** & **cell2location**
> - **Docker Desktop** — official image, runs on CPU with demo data → best for **DeepVariant**
> - **WSL2** — general fallback for the rest

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adtyapnda/variant-prioritization-team1.git
   ```
2. Work inside your paper's folder under `papers/`.
3. Commit your setup steps, run scripts / notebooks, and output files.
4. Add a short note in your folder's README describing what the output shows.
